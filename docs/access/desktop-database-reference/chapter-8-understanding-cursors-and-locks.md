# Chapter 8: Understanding cursors and locks

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

It is important to understand how cursors operate so you can select the best and most efficient cursor type for an application's data-access requirements. A less-than-optimal cursor configuration can make data-access operations painfully slow.

Many capabilities of the ADO **Recordset** object are determined by the type and location of the cursor, as well as the lock type.

This chapter covers the following topics:

- [What is a cursor?](what-is-a-cursor.md)
- [The significance of cursor location](the-significance-of-cursor-location.md)
- [The Microsoft Cursor Service for OLE DB](the-microsoft-cursor-service-for-ole-db.md)
- [Using CacheSize](using-cachesize.md)
- [Cursor and lock characteristics](cursor-and-lock-characteristics.md)
- [Types of cursors (ADO)](types-of-cursors.md)
- [What is a lock? (ADO)](what-is-a-lock.md)
