# Index.Unique property (DAO)

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

Sets or returns a value that indicates whether an **[Index](index-object-dao.md)** object represents a unique (key) index for a table (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax

*expression* .Unique

*expression* A variable that represents an **Index** object.

## Remarks

This property setting is read/write until the object is appended to a collection, after which it's read-only.

A unique index consists of one or more fields that logically arrange all records in a table in a unique, predefined order. If the index consists of one field, values in that field must be unique for the entire table. If the index consists of more than one field, each field can contain duplicate values, but each combination of values from all the indexed fields must be unique.

If both the **Unique** and **[Primary](index-primary-property-dao.md)** properties of an **Index** object are set to **True**, the index is unique and primary: It uniquely identifies all records in the table in a predefined, logical order. If the **Primary** property is set to **False**, the index is a secondary index. Secondary indexes (both key and nonkey) logically arrange records in a predefined order without serving as an identifier for records in the table.

> [!NOTE]
> - You don't have to create indexes for tables, but in large, unindexed tables, accessing a specific record can take a long time.
> - Records retrieved from tables without indexes are returned in no particular sequence.
> - The **[Attributes](field-attributes-property-dao.md)** property of each **[Field](field-object-dao.md)** object in the **Index** object determines the order of records and consequently determines the access techniques to use for that **Index** object.
> - A unique index helps optimize finding records.
> - Indexes don't affect the physical order of a base table; indexes affect only how the records are accessed by the table-type **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** object when a particular index is chosen or when the Microsoft Access database engine creates **Recordset** objects.

## Example

This example sets the **Unique** property of a new **Index** object to **True**, and appends the Index to the **Indexes** collection of the Employees table. It then enumerates the **Indexes** collection of the **TableDef** and the **Properties** collection of each **Index**. The new **Index** will only allow one record with a particular combination of Country, LastName, and FirstName in the **TableDef**.

```vb
    Sub UniqueX() 
     
       Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
       Dim tdfEmployees As TableDef 
       Dim idxNew As Index 
       Dim idxLoop As Index 
       Dim prpLoop As Property 
     
       Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
       Set tdfEmployees = dbsNorthwind!Employees 
     
       With tdfEmployees 
          ' Create and append new Index object to the Indexes  
          ' collection of the Employees table. 
          Set idxNew = .CreateIndex("NewIndex") 
     
          With idxNew 
             .Fields.Append .CreateField("Country") 
             .Fields.Append .CreateField("LastName") 
             .Fields.Append .CreateField("FirstName") 
             .Unique = True 
          End With 
     
          .Indexes.Append idxNew 
          .Indexes.Refresh 
     
          Debug.Print .Indexes.Count & " Indexes in " & _ 
             .Name & " TableDef" 
     
          ' Enumerate Indexes collection of Employees table. 
          For Each idxLoop In .Indexes 
             Debug.Print "  " & idxLoop.Name 
     
             ' Enumerate Properties collection of each Index  
             ' object. 
             For Each prpLoop In idxLoop.Properties 
                Debug.Print "    " & prpLoop.Name & _ 
                   " = " & IIf(prpLoop = "", "[empty]", prpLoop) 
             Next prpLoop 
     
          Next idxLoop 
     
          ' Delete new Index because this is a demonstration. 
          .Indexes.Delete idxNew.Name 
       End With 
     
       dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub
```
