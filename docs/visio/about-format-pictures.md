# About Format Pictures

A format picture is used to determine how a value is displayed. For example, you can control the number of digits displayed to the right or left of a decimal point, or whether a text string appears as uppercase or lowercase.
  
> [!NOTE]
> To define a date or time format picture by using Microsoft Office system formatting, enclose the format picture in double curly braces , for example, "{{m/d/yy}}". If you are using a predefined format, for example, 201, enclose it in curly braces and angle brackets, like this: "{\<201\>}" 
  
The following sections show symbols you can use to format different types of values for display.
  
## String and numeric values

|**Character**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|#  <br/> |Digit placeholder. Displays either a digit or nothing. Leading and trailing zeros are not displayed. If more digits than placeholders are to the left of the decimal, all digits are displayed. If more digits than placeholders are to the right of the decimal, the fraction is rounded to the number of placeholders. For a dimension, if the placeholder is the leftmost digit, subunits that are 0 are not displayed.  <br/> For example, FORMAT(0ft 11.25in,"#.##u") displays 11.25in.  <br/> |
|0  <br/> |Digit placeholder (zero). Displays either a digit or nothing. Leading and trailing zeros are displayed. If more digits than placeholders are to the left of the decimal, all digits are displayed. If more digits than placeholders are to the right of the decimal, the fraction is rounded to the number of placeholders. For a dimension, subunits that are 0 are displayed.  <br/> For example, FORMAT(2ft 11.33in,"0.## u") displays 2 ft. 11.33 in.  <br/> |
|.  <br/> |Decimal placeholder. Determines how many digits are displayed to the left and right of the decimal position. In a multipart unit, the decimal is used in the smallest (rightmost) subunit. Displays the decimal character defined for the system's **Region and Language** settings (Control Panel).  <br/> For example, FORMAT(250 cm,"0.000 u") displays 250.000 cm.  <br/> |
|,  <br/> |Thousands separator. If surrounded by digit placeholders (# or 0), the separator separates thousands from hundreds within a number that has four or more digits to the left of the decimal. Displays the thousands separator defined for the system's **Region and Language** settings (Control Panel).  <br/> |
|E- E+ e- e+  <br/> |Scientific format. If the format contains at least one digit placeholder to the right of these symbols, the number is displayed in scientific format. Inserts the E or e between the number and its exponent. For E+ or e+, displays the plus (+) sign before positive exponents and the minus (-) sign before negative exponents. For E- or e-, displays the minus (-) sign only when the exponent is negative.  <br/> For example, FORMAT(12345.67,"###.#e+#") displays 123.5e+2.  <br/> |
|u or U  <br/> |Short label placeholder. Inserts abbreviated unit labels after each subunit. For example: in., ft., deg. The U placeholder inserts mixed-case labels, while the u placeholder inserts lowercase labels. Inserts the same number of spaces before the label as before the placeholder.  <br/> For example, FORMAT(12 c 13 d,"#u") displays 13c1.  <br/> |
|uu or UU  <br/> |Long label placeholder. Inserts unit labels after each subunit. For example: inches, feet, degrees The U placeholder inserts mixed-case labels, while the u placeholder inserts lowercase labels. Inserts the same number of spaces before the label as before the placeholder.  <br/> For example, FORMAT(12.43in,"# #/4 UU") displays 12 2/4 INCHES.  <br/> |
|uuu or UUU  <br/> |Universal label placeholder. Inserts the universal (internal to Visio) form of unit labels after each subunit. The U placeholder inserts mixed-case labels, while the u placeholder inserts lowercase labels. Inserts the same number of spaces before the label as before the placeholder.  <br/> |
|/  <br/> |Fraction placeholder. Displays expression as a whole number with fraction if a leading digit placeholder is present. Otherwise, displays only the whole number in the numerator. If a number follows the digit placeholder in the denominator, rounds the fraction to the nearest fraction whose numerator is 1 and simplifies it. If a number is specified in the denominator without the digit placeholder, rounds to the nearest fraction but does not simplify it.  <br/> For example, FORMAT(12.43,"# #/4") displays 12 2/4.  <br/> |
|space  <br/> |Displays a space character in the formatted output. To display another character, use the backslash (\) character.  <br/> |
   
## Currency values

|**Character**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|$  <br/> |Currency symbol. Displays the currency symbol defined for the system's **Region and Language** settings (Control Panel)  <br/> |
|u or U  <br/> |Short label placeholder. Inserts the standard symbol for local currency or the three-character currency abbreviations for nonlocal currencies. For example, $99.00, 42.70 FRF. The u placeholder inserts lowercase, and U inserts mixed-case labels.  <br/> |
|uu or UU  <br/> |Long label placeholder. Inserts long currency labels after each subunit. For example: U.S. dollar, French franc. The u placeholder inserts lowercase, and U inserts mixed-case labels.  <br/> |
|uuu or UUU  <br/> |Universal label placeholder. Inserts the universal, three-character currency abbreviations for all currencies after each subunit. For example, 99.00 USD, 42.70 FRF. The u placeholder inserts lowercase, and U inserts mixed-case labels. Inserts the same number of spaces before the label as before the placeholder.  <br/> |
   
## Text values

|**Character**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|\  <br/> |Displays the next character as is. To display the backslash character, type \\. See also "text".  <br/> |
|"text" or 'text'  <br/> |Displays the text enclosed in quotation marks as is. See also \ (backslash).  <br/> |
|@  <br/> |Text placeholder. Replaces a string if the value of an expression is a string.  <br/> For example, FORMAT("Hello", "'You entered ('@')'" ) results in "You entered (Hello)".  <br/> |
|@+  <br/> |Uppercase text placeholder. For string values, substitutes the input with uppercase.  <br/> For example, FORMAT("Hello", "@ @+ @-" ) results in "Hello HELLO hello)".  <br/> |
|@-  <br/> |Text placeholder. For string values, substitutes the input with lowercase.  <br/> For example, FORMAT("Hello", "@ @+ @-" ) results in "Hello HELLO hello)".  <br/> |
   
## Date values

|**Character**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|c or C  <br/> |Date or time placeholder. Displays date and time values using a short (c) or long (C) date format, and the general time format.

FORMAT(DATETIME("Jun. 25, 2007"),"c") displays 6/25/2007.  <br/> |
