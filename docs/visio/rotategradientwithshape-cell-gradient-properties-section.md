# RotateGradientWithShape Cell (Gradient Properties Section)

Determines whether a fill gradient rotates with a shape in 2D rotation, as a boolean.
  
|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|TRUE  <br/> |The gradient rotates with the shape when the shape is rotated around the rotation pin. The "top" of the gradient is parallel to the rotation handle.  <br/> |
|FALSE  <br/> |The gradient does not rotate with the shape when the shape is rotated around the rotation pin. The "top" of the gradient is parallel to the drawing canvas.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

To get a reference to the **RotateGradientWithShape** cell by name from another formula, by value of the **N** attribute of a **Cell** element, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
| Cell name:  <br/> | RotateGradientWithShape  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the **RotateGradientWithShape** cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
| Section index:  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
| Row index:  <br/> |**visRowGradientProperties** <br/> |
| Cell index:  <br/> |**visRotateGradientWithShape** <br/> |
